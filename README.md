# Apache Poi 5.0.0 and JPMS
## A maven project showing how the two can work together - without batik etc. related issues

Apache POI 5.0 is supposed to be [fully compatible with JPMS](https://poi.apache.org/) but in practice we still hit errors related to missing modules descriptors etc.

[Andreas Beeker](https://github.com/kiwiwings) posted a working demo project for Apache POI x JPMs, as [a comment to a bug report on the bugzilla platform of the Apache Foundation](https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=65103#c11).

This repo is merely a republishing of this project, to make it easier to discover and re-use. Thanks to Andreas and enjoy!
